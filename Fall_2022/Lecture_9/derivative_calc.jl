# Fornberg algorithm

# This implements the Fornberg (1988) algorithm (https://doi.org/10.1090/S0025-5718-1988-0935077-0)
# to obtain Finite Difference weights over arbitrary points to arbitrary order

function calculate_weights(order::Int, x0::T, x::AbstractVector) where T<:Real
    #=
        order: The derivative order for which we need the coefficients
        x0   : The point in the array 'x' for which we need the coefficients
        x    : A dummy array with relative coordinates, eg. central differences
               need coordinates centred at 0 while those at boundaries need
               coordinates starting from 0 to the end point
        The approximation order of the stencil is automatically determined from
        the number of requested stencil points.

        This is to fix the problem of numerical instability which occurs when the sum of the stencil_coefficients is not
        exactly 0.

#example

u = rand(11)  #generate random response
t = range(0.0, 1.0, 11)

#calculate 2nd derivative at t=0.5 seconds
index = findfirst(time->time==0.5, t)
order = 2 #second derivative
x = t[index-2:index+2] #stencil range
x0 = t[index]  #local where derivative is being calculated

#calculate Taylor series coeff, i.e. finite difference stencil
stencil = calculate_weights(order, x0, x)

utt = stencil' * u[index-2:index+2]  #acceleration at t=0.5 seconds

#calculate 2nd derivative at t=0.0 seconds
# index = findfirst(time->time==0.0, t)
order = 2 #second derivative
x = t[1:5] #stencil range
x0 = t[1]  #local where derivative is being calculated
